# Wealth-of-Nation-Project-

About The Dataset 
The Wealth of nations dataset on Excel. I opened the excel table and familiarise myself with its content. I noticed that there are three tabs. I worked with the first tab named GDP for the excel work

I then did all the cleaning on Excel before Importing the ‘The Wealth of nations’ into Tableau and setting a relationship between the 3 sheets. 
There are three sheets and the common column for all of the sheet is country, so i use the country columns to create relationship within the 3 sheets.
After importing I create a dashboard using the dataset that cleaned dataset that I imported, after the dashboard i then uploaded to Tableau public where i can save and also be visible for people to see it. 

The requirements The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All your visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

I used Tableaus to make my dasboard. See below links
